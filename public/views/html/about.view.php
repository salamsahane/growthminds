            <p class="text-justify">
                On the 5th of March 2020 GROWTH MINDSET LTD founder and CEO, Ebonje Dieudonne Ewesum created an
                internet-based learning platform, set up to produce simple teachers' notes and video lectures to support
                classroom lectures and enhance students understanding especially for students who have been deprived of
                education in Cameroon as a result of the Anglophone crises. These students could now use the internet
                through our virtual learning environment to study where they are and can register and take their exams
                ensuring career progress.

            <h3 class="">WHY YOU SHOULD USE A VIRTUAL LEARNING ENVIRONMENT (VLE)</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">
                In the last 10 years, education has benefited from a real e-revolution - most schools and universities
                now have a functioning Virtual Learning Environment (VLE), at the heart of their teaching and e-learning
                programs – a virtual ‘shadow', if you will. A VLE, or learning platform, is an online system that allows
                teachers to share educational materials with their students via the web. For a student to be able to
                access a ‘Virtual’ room as either a duplicate or extension of their physical classroom is a clear
                advantage for learners and teachers alike. Every educational establishment ought to integrate a VLE into
                their lessons and allow it to become second nature to learners and educators outside of the classroom.
                Student satisfaction and academic performance could be improved through the use of a web-based
                educational resource.

            <h3>HOW TECHNOLOGY IN THE CLASSROOM IS CHANGING THE FACE OF EDUCATION </h3>
            <p class="text-justify">
                Education is evolving fast. Just as technology plays a key role in our everyday lives, it's now
                transforming how students learn in the classroom. In today's digitally driven world, students must
                become familiar with technology from a young age. By incorporating technology into every aspect of
                school life, children/students will learn the skills and knowledge that they need to thrive in our
                fast-moving society. We look at how technology in the classroom is changing education as we know it, and
                find out how videos can help students to appreciate how accelerated changes in the digital world are
                shaping our future.
            </p>
            <h3>UNIVERSITY EDUCATION AND TECHNOLOGY </h3>
            <p class="text-justify">
                Advances in technology are also changing the way that university students learn. It's now standard
                practice to take a course online, and the advent of the digital age has made it much easier for students
                to take courses through distance learning. Technology has enabled students from different colleges to
                share information by creating online learning communities where they can enjoy debates and discussions
                on the same specialist topic. One of the biggest transformations for university learning is, of course,
                the internet. Students can now find specialist reports and articles on a vast range of subjects,
                encouraging them to delve deeper into their chosen topic and challenge their points of view.
            </p>
            <h3>WHY EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY VIDEOS ARE CRUCIAL LEARNING TOOLS </h3>
            <p class="text-justify">
                Students are experiencing new developments in technology every day, both at school and at home. As well
                as becoming accustomed to using digital tools while learning, it’s also vital that students understand
                the context of these advances and what they mean for today’s society. One of the most effective ways to
                help students to learn more about the power of technology is through educational videos. These videos
                are an invaluable teaching resource to bring the impact of the digital age alive in the classroom.
                <br><br>
                There’s no doubt that the use of technology in education has changed the face of school and university
                life as we know it. There are some major benefits to these advances in technology: Students can become
                truly active learners, with more innovative educational games and tools open to them than ever before.
                Classrooms can enjoy greater collaboration and schools and universities and institutions of higher
                learning can save money on replacing traditional textbooks or learning tools such as calculators. The
                integration of technology and education also means that our youngest generations can be prepared for the
                even greater digital expansion that will certainly lie ahead.
